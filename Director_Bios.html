            <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">David is a
                professional software engineer with a masters in artificial
                intelligence. His career spans over 25 years in high tech
                startups developing decision support applications and
                distributed systems, most recently in the advanced medical
                imaging industry. As a technical leader David has experience as
                a development manager, trainer, UX designer and CTO but he is
                most passionate about designing and coding software.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">David is
                fascinated by the nature of intelligence (natural, artificial
                and collaborative) and passionate about building technology to
                enhance intelligence. This led to inventing systems to enable
                better decision making: a quantitative reputation system
                (Meridion), a project schedule estimation system (Galton), and a
                gamified software development process (Nomicon). As a vocal
                proponent of the hacker ethic, David shared these inventions as
                open source.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As a
                futurist David has been involved in the transhumanist community
                since the early 90s. He served as list administrator, webmaster,
                and ultimately a director of the Extropy Institute. He presented
                one of the first implementations of an online prediction market
                at the Extro-2 conference which later won a Golden Nica from
                Prix Ars Electronica. He also developed and hosted the site for
                the influential online conference Vital Progress Summit which
                generated the Proactionary Principle.</span></p>
